        println!("{}", n);        //This will still work because, remember, we can have as many read-only borrows of a variable as we want. m and n are just reading from the same value, not changing it. this is actually fine !
        pointer_argument(&n);
        //So what now, can i use n ???? i mean, it was immutable, wasnt it ? so i'm not passing ownership, just creating another read-only borrow in a function. i think this should work
        println!("{}", n);      //And I'm right ! I'm getting the hang of this ^^
        //However i wont be able to do a mutable borrow (passing of ownership, read-write borrow, same thing), yet, because i cant do that so long as other variables are borrowing it, or in other words, as long as other read-only pointers are pointing to it.

        //What, the actual, fuck
        //Maybe this has to do with the "if unused, then non existant ðŸ§˜" (lets give this a name... "The Fallen Tree Conjecture" !
